# TortoisesWin
Favorite animal activity

## Elements Used
I used my basic html skills, CSS styling, and Bootstrap styling.

## Things to Improve On
-Image headings disappear when screen is small, I want them to stay no matter the size

-Add a footer with a link to my tortoises pinterest board

-Having trouble with making my background image it's own element. I want to make it independant of the body so I can change the opacity of the image.
